# ChannelFlow-Server

Simulated live TV for [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org). This repository is **ChannelFlow-Server** — a .NET 10 app with a red Jellyfin-style Web UI, PostgreSQL, local library playback, WeatherStar, and news.

Home: [github.com/binarygeek119/ChannelFlow](https://github.com/binarygeek119/ChannelFlow)  
Client: [github.com/binarygeek119/ChannelFlow-Client](https://github.com/binarygeek119/ChannelFlow-Client)  
Commercial detect: [github.com/binarygeek119/ChannelFlow-CommercialDetect](https://github.com/binarygeek119/ChannelFlow-CommercialDetect)  
Discord: [discord.gg/w7GK7Zufts](https://discord.gg/w7GK7Zufts)

ChannelFlow talks to media servers itself (Jellyfin now; Emby and Plex connections are placeholders). Add Live TV in Jellyfin with this server's M3U and XMLTV URLs from the **Copy M3U** and **Copy XMLTV** buttons at the top of the web UI.

## What runs where

| ChannelFlow-Server | Jellyfin / other players |
| --- | --- |
| Channels, lineups, playout, FFmpeg MPEG-TS | Add M3U + XMLTV as a Live TV tuner |
| Library connections (Jellyfin, sidecar .nfo, Emby/Plex later) | Same media files ChannelFlow can read |
| Commercials / CommercialBrainz | |
| EBS, logos, AI lineups | |
| WeatherStar 4000/3000 (native compositor, vendored ws4kp/ws3kp) | |
| News RSS + TTS channel | |
| Web UI (username/password) | |

Playback reads **local files**. On **Library → Connections**, set path remaps per server (media-server prefix → ChannelFlow mount), for example `/data/media` → `/media`.

## Requirements

- .NET 10 SDK to build, or a self-contained publish from `scripts/publish-native.sh`
- PostgreSQL (your own instance)
- FFmpeg on PATH (or set `FFMPEG_PATH`). The Docker image is based on [ersatztv-ffmpeg](https://github.com/ErsatzTV/ErsatzTV-ffmpeg) (`/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg`), same stack as [ErsatzTV/legacy](https://github.com/ErsatzTV/legacy).
- Jellyfin 10+ (or sidecar folders). Emby and Plex connections can be saved now; catalog sync for those comes later
- The same media paths readable by Jellyfin and ChannelFlow-Server

## Run

Clone with the commercial-detect submodule:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/binarygeek119/ChannelFlow.git
# already cloned: git submodule update --init --recursive
```

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# optional: set JELLYFIN_URL. PostgreSQL can be configured in the web UI on first launch.
dotnet publish src/ChannelFlow.Server/ChannelFlow.Server.csproj -c Release
# or: bash scripts/publish-native.sh linux-x64
```

Load the `.env` values into the process environment, then run `ChannelFlow.Server` (from `bin/.../publish` or `artifacts/native/linux-x64`). Listen port is `PORT` (default `8097`). Config, logos, weather, and news files live under `CHANNELFLOW_CONFIG` (default `config` next to the app). Postgres connection details are stored in `database.json` in that folder unless `POSTGRES_HOST` is set (Docker/Unraid). Channel bugs ship in `src/ChannelFlow.Server/wwwroot/images/logos` (copied into the config logos folder on startup). EBS graphics and Off Air slates are in `wwwroot/images/media`, alert/news audio in `wwwroot/audio`, and bundled bumpers in `wwwroot/videos`.

Local from source (Fedora/podman): `bash scripts/dev.sh` starts Postgres on `127.0.0.1:5433` and `dotnet run` on `http://127.0.0.1:8097`.

Then:

1. Open `http://<host>:8097`. On first launch, enter PostgreSQL host/port/database/user/password, then create the admin username and password
2. Open **Library → Connections**. Add a Jellyfin server (URL + API key) or a sidecar folder of local files with `.nfo` metadata. Use **Test server**, refresh libraries, then **Sync catalog**
3. Set path remaps on that server card so ChannelFlow can open the same files
4. Copy the M3U and XMLTV URLs from the top of the web UI. In Jellyfin Live TV, add those as a tuner and guide

Items removed from a media server, or whose remapped local file is gone, are marked missing, then deleted by **Library → Removed items** (or Tasks) after the grace period (default 7 days). **Scan local files** checks each catalog path after remap.

Set `FFMPEG_HWACCEL=vaapi` or `qsv` and pass `/dev/dri` access for Intel VAAPI / Quick Sync. The container ships ersatztv-ffmpeg 8.1.2 (VAAPI, QSV, NVENC, libva 2.23).

In Jellyfin, add ChannelFlow's M3U and XMLTV URLs from the top of the web UI under Live TV (tuner + guide).

## Reverse proxy

ChannelFlow expects to sit behind Nginx Proxy Manager, SWAG, Caddy, or Traefik on a hostname such as `https://channelflow.example.duckdns.org`. Forward `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, and `X-Forwarded-For`. Leave live MPEG-TS unbuffered (`proxy_buffering off` / Caddy `flush_interval -1`) and raise the read timeout (an hour is enough).

Optional env vars:

- `CHANNELFLOW_PUBLIC_URL` — public origin used in M3U/XMLTV when Jellyfin fetches them from another host (example: `https://channelflow.example.duckdns.org`)
- `CHANNELFLOW_PATH_BASE` — only if the UI is served under a subpath such as `/channelflow`

Legacy `FINTV_*` names for those same variables still work.

You can also set **Public base URL** on the General tab. Login cookies stay valid across restarts (keys live in the config folder under `dataprotection`).

Nginx:

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8097;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_request_buffering off;
    proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
    proxy_send_timeout 3600s;
}
```

Caddy:

```caddy
channelflow.example.duckdns.org {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8097 {
        flush_interval -1
    }
}
```

## Weather and news

WeatherStar graphics are vendored from [ws4kp](https://github.com/netbymatt/ws4kp) and [ws3kp](https://github.com/netbymatt/ws3kp) (MIT) and rendered by the native compositor, then encoded to MPEG-TS with optional Jellyfin music as a bed.

News is a 24/7 channel: RSS feeds from the **News** page, optional TTS, FFmpeg overlay, and bed music.

## License

ChannelFlow-Server code follows this repository's license. WeatherStar vendors keep their upstream MIT licenses.
